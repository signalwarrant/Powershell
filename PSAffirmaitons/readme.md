## PSAffirmations

If you ever find yourself looking deep into your PowerShell console or VSCode wondering if you will ever figure out that last bit of code... you will. Add a small piece of code to your PowerShell profile and you will get a new random affirmation every time you open a console window.

Why, you ask? Because the world needs just a little bit more positive.

Feel free to take this and make it your own or send a PR to add to the list of affirmations.
