# PSAffirmations

If you ever find yourself looking deep into your PowerShell console or VSCode wondering if you will ever figure out that last bit of code... you will. Maybe you need a bit of reassurance or positive reinforcement to get you over the virtual hump... I know I do sometimes. Add a small piece of code to your PowerShell profile and you will get a new random affirmation every time you open a PowerShell console window.

**Why, you ask? Because the world needs just a little bit more positive.**

Feel free to take this and make it your own or send a PR to add to the list of affirmations.

## Usage

All you need to do to test drive this is grab the code from the profile.ps1 and paste it in your PowerShell profile... that's it.

As an alternative, you could fork or download the files and host the json in your own repo or even locally I suppose.

## Longer Term

This is a simple minimum viable product at this point. Thinking longer term this could be turned into a module so you have the ability to edit the affirmation file locally of course, maybe have some ability to style the font in the console to jazz it up a bit. 

Perhaps I'll work on some of this when I get a chance but odds are I'll see something else interesting roll by my desk and move on... that's kind of how I work. :)
